What's new:
- Minor breaking change. If you have changed the date time format in the settings before, it will no longer work as expected. 
I have removed the option and added a more comprehensive list. If you are much more adventurous,  there is an option to fill in your own date time format. 

- When changing language or theme, you will be prompted to restart instead of restarting immediately 

Fix:
- Fix transaction screen not going back to dashboard when clicking back button
- Fix an issue where old data will appear when adding transaction
- Fix an issue where progress circle will not appear
