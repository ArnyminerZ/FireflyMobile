Sorry for being inactive recently; The pandemic, life, uni and work has put me in a really bad place. I just feel really burnt out. 
I will be putting development on hold till the end of Oct 2021. 


Features:

- Easier UI for single handed users while dealing with transactions
- 

Bug Fixes: 
- Fix bug where duplicate transaction will fail
- Fix bug where deleting will fail
- Fix bug where loading indicator will not block when deleting transaction
- Fix deposit data from current month(Fixes #177). Thanks to @leander091 for the fix!
