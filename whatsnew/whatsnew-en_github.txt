Hello everyone! I have been busy recently having recently graduated and working a full time job now. New features and bug fixes may be slow.
This is a major update as I have added support for multi user support (#174). A lot of work was put into this to migrate exisiting users 
seamlessly. If you are intending to use this as a single user, nothing to worry about! If you are intending to use this app for multiple 
domains / emails, any exisitng offline jobs(pending transaction / attachments / bills) will use whatever default account that was set.
If you have no exisiting offline jobs, you are all clear. 

This will be the last release for 2021. Merry Christmas and happy new year everyone!
