What's new:
- Minor breaking change. If you have changed the date time format in the settings before, it will no longer work as expected. 
I have removed the option and added a more comprehensive list. If you are much more adventurous,  there is an option to fill in your own date time format. 


Fix:
- Fix transaction screen not going back to dashboard when clicking back button
- Fix an issue where old data will appear when adding transaction
