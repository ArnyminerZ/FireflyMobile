Small release. I have opened up [an API](https://github.com/emansih/FireflyMobile/commit/6ba53a72f66d08fc0216cfd92d9e5067222a5467) to allow consumers to interact with the main app via OCR. The first app to utilise it is made by Luis Mor√≥n.

You can find the app [here](https://github.com/luifermoron/ocrFireflyMobile).
